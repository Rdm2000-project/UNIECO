# UNIECO
this is a shortened privacy version of the project done by me and two of my other colleagues during the three-year university course. A project aimed at increasing awareness about eco-sustainable practices in university or work facilities.

# UNIECO – Sustainable Behavior Monitoring App
This is a **shortened public version** of a project developed by me and two colleagues during our three-year university degree.  
The goal of the project is to **raise awareness of eco-sustainable practices** within university or workplace environments, by promoting responsible behaviors and monitoring energy and resource usage through a mobile application.

## Executive Summary

UNIECO is based on the shared vision of supporting the shift towards a more sustainable management of energy resources.  
The system offers students and users a mobile application that:
- Monitors behaviors related to energy and water usage,
- Provides personalized feedback,
- Encourages eco-friendly habits through gamification and incentives.

The service focuses on data collection and analysis to:
- Support energy waste reduction,
- Inform maintenance operations,
- Promote conscious usage of purified water and other renewable resources.

The project’s mission is to **turn sustainability from a concept into daily action**, particularly in educational contexts.

## Technologies

- Mobile App (Android beta prototype)
- Sensor data integration (energy & water)
- Backend for data analysis (mocked in this version)

## Business Model

Revenue is expected to come primarily from monthly subscriptions paid by universities, with possible scalability to companies and other institutions.  
Secondary income streams include branded gadgets and reusable water bottles.
