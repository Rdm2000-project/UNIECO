# UNIECO â€“ Sustainable Behavior Monitoring App
This is a **shortened public version** of a project developed by me and two colleagues during our three-year university degree.  
The goal of the project is to **raise awareness of eco-sustainable practices** within university or workplace environments, by promoting responsible behaviors and monitoring energy and resource usage through a mobile application.

## Executive Summary

UNIECO is based on the common idea of giving voice to the increasingly evident forms of generalized sensitivity to an energy resource management system with ample room for improvement.The intent is to provide customers with a useful tool, effective in **promoting eco-friendly** habits and distribution of primary resources, managed consumptively by a mobile application.
**The offering presented by the company focuses, almost exclusively, on monitoring services that observe students' behaviors to draw up a sustainability plan by incentivizing them to improve their habits**. The monitoring will not only serve to collect data related to adopted behaviors but, by leveraging technologies that will help accomplish the aforementioned goal, will provide data related to optimizing energy waste in the university facility, thus also managing to offer a facility maintenance assistance service. Considering the goal that the company wants to pursue, which is to improve sustainability through technologies, it is possible to assert that the market area that the company refers to is still little explored despite the fact that the market for mobile applications is continuously expanding, making the service distribution mode the very strength of the project.
The mission is completely focused on the discourse of eco-sustainability; in fact, **the services aim to catalyze environmentally sustainable practices through incentives and the use of renewable resources, such as purified water**. The topic of green policies is very relevant, and despite this, initiatives for more responsible use of various types of scarce resources are few compared to the real need. 
The ultimate goal of the company is to give people a tool capable of making them more aware and willing to change their behavior in the name of the well-being of the university system.
As far as the economic-financial discourse is concerned, it is planned to obtain a fair amount of revenue that will be received mainly through a monthly fee obtained from the University, but it will be possible to extend it to in-loco companies given the high scalability of the business model. Less importance will be given to the business related to the sale of gadgets and water bottles.
The amount of capital to be invested will be generated essentially by the equipment that the business will use to fulfill the functions useful for service delivery (sensors, water dispensers, gadgets) while, as far as the mobile application is concerned, a team of programmers will be in charge of creating and managing it in an increasingly effective way.

## Technologies

- Mobile App (Android beta prototype)
- Sensor data integration (energy & water)
- Backend for data analysis (mocked in this version)

## Business Model

Revenue is expected to come primarily from monthly subscriptions paid by universities, with possible scalability to companies and other institutions.  
Secondary income streams include branded gadgets and reusable water bottles.
